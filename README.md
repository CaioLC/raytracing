# Raytracing exercise

This is a rust implementation of the [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) book, by Peter Shirley, Trevor David Black and Steve Hollasch, version 4.0.0-alpha.

The book is originally written with C++ code. I've followed through and implemented in Rust for practice.
